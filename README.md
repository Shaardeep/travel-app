## Project Achievements (Completed So Far) | 30-05-2025

- Created a clean project workspace with a single repository and separate folders for frontend, backend, docker, and documentation.
- Successfully set up a Next.js application using the App Router, TypeScript, ESLint, and modern configuration best practices.
- Installed and configured Node.js inside WSL (Ubuntu) using NVM, ensuring a proper Linux-based development environment independent of Windows Node.
- Initialized a Node.js + Express backend with essential middleware (cors, dotenv) and a clean entry point structure.
- Implemented a backend health check API (`/health`) to verify server availability and correctness.
- Verified backend functionality locally using browser and command-line testing.
- Established environment variable management for frontend and backend using `.env` files.
- Connected the Next.js frontend to the Node.js backend through a shared API configuration.
- Implemented a frontend API helper layer to consume backend services in a clean, reusable way.
- Displayed real-time backend status on the frontend UI, confirming end-to-end communication.
- Validated a working full-stack development flow (WSL → Frontend → Backend → API response).
- Followed a phased, production-style setup approach aligned with real-world engineering practices.
- Designed and implemented a role-based authentication system supporting User, Vendor, and Admin roles.
- Implemented JWT-based authentication with protected backend routes.
- Verified protected route access using Authorization headers and JWT tokens.
- Built and tested a complete OTP-based login flow (request OTP → verify OTP → issue JWT).
- Implemented backend middleware for role-based access control.
- Successfully tested authentication and authorization flows using `curl` commands.
- Ensured clean separation of concerns using controllers, services, and middleware layers.
- Established a scalable backend structure suitable for future database and service integration.
